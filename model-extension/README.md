# Deep Learning Model Extension of TrainingDML-AI

## 1. Abstract
The objective of the deep learning model extension (model-extension) is to develop the UML model and encodings to describe geospatial deep learning models. The model-extension will align with TrainingDML-AI and OGC standards baseline to facilitate the sharing, exchange, reusability, and inference of models in the web environment.

## 2. Introduction
The purpose of the TrainingDML-AI Use Cases is to demonstrate the task scenarios and training datasets that enable the modeling and use of TrainingDML:
