# Deep Learning Model Extension of TrainingDML-AI

## 1. Abstract
The objective of the deep learning model extension (model-extension) is to develop the UML model and encoding to describe geospatial deep learning models. The model-extension will align with TrainingDML-AI and OGC standards baseline to facilitate the sharing, exchange, reusability, and inference of models in the web environment.

## 2. Scope of Work
The model-extension will undertake the following work actions around geospatial deep learning models:
- Design the UML model and encoding of geospatial deep learning models, maximize the findability, interoperability, and reusability of models;
- Define the description of neural network and optimization method of models;
- Define the description of model quality(e.g., performance metrics, computational complexity, generalization, robustness);
- Define the JSON schema for encoding geospatial deep learning models;
- Best practices for documenting, storing, evaluating, managing, and sharing the geospatial deep learning models.

## 3. UML Model
The core concepts of the model-extension are presented in Figure 1, followed by the specific concrete classes in Figure 2.
The core concepts includes:
