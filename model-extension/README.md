# Deep Learning Model Extension of TrainingDML-AI
## 1. Abstract
The deep learning model extension (model-extension) aims to develop the UML model and encodings to describe geospatial deep learning models. The model-extension will consistent with TrainingDML-AI and OGC standards baseline to promote the model sharing, exchange, reusability, and inference in the web environment.
## 2. Introduction
The purpose of the TrainingDML-AI Use Cases is to demonstrate the task scenarios and training datasets that enable the modeling and use of TrainingDML:
