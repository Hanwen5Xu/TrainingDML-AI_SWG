|A |Any implementation standard SHALL contain an element which represents the same concept as that defined for the UML class.
|B |Any implementation standard SHALL represent associations with the same source, target, direction, roles, and multiplicities as those of the UML class.
|C |Any implementation standard SHALL represent the attributes of the UML class, including the name, definition, type, and multiplicity.
|D |Any implementation standard SHALL represent the attributes of all super classes of the UML class, including the name, definition, type, and multiplicity.

2+|For each UML class defined or referenced in AI_TrainingData
|A |An implementation standard MAY represent that class as a null class with no attributes, associations, or definition.
|B |An implementation standard MAY represent an association of the UML class with a null association.
|C |An implementation standard MAY represent an attribute of the UML class with a null attribute.
|D |Whenever a null element is used to represent a concept from the AI_TrainingData, the implementation standard SHOULD document that mapping and provide an explanation for why that concept was not implemented.
