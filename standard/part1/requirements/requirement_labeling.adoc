|A |An implementation standard MAY represent that class as a null class with no attributes, associations, or definition.
|B |An implementation standard MAY represent an association of the UML class with a null association.
|C |An implementation standard MAY represent an attribute of the UML class with a null attribute.
|D |Whenever a null element is used to represent a concept from the AI_Labeling, the implementation standard SHOULD document that mapping and provide an explanation for why that concept was not implemented.
