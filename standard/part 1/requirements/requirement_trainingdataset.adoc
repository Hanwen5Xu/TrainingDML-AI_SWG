2+|For each UML class defined or referenced in AI_TrainingDataset conceptual model
|A |Any implementation standard SHALL contain an element which represents the same concept as that defined for the UML class.
|B |Any implementation standard SHALL represent associations with the same source, target, direction, roles, and multiplicities as those of the UML class.
|C |Any implementation standard SHALL represent the attributes of the UML class including the name, definition, type, and multiplicity.
|D |Any implementation standard SHALL represent the attributes of all super classes of the UML class including the name, definition, type, and multiplicity.
|E |Any implementation standard SHALL represent the associations of all super classes of the UML class including the source, target, direction, roles, and multiplicity.
|F |Any implementation standard SHALL specify how an implementation observes all constraints the Conceptual Model imposes on the UML class.
|===

An implementing technology may not be able to support all the concepts defined in the TrainingDML-AI UML model. Alternately, some concepts may be inappropriate for the application domain for which the implementation standard was developed. In those cases, elements of the UML model may be mapped to null elements.

2+|/per/aitrainingdataset/classes
2+|For each UML class defined or referenced in AI_TrainingDataset
|A |An implementation standard MAY represent that class as a null class with no attributes, associations, or definition.
|B |An implementation standard MAY represent an association of the UML class with a null association.
|C |An implementation standard MAY represent an attribute of the UML class with a null attribute.
|D |Whenever a null element is used to represent a concept from the AI_TrainingDataset, the implementation standard SHOULD document that mapping and provide an explanation for why that concept was not implemented.
