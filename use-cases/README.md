# TrainingDML-AI Use Cases & Requirement
## 1. Abstract
This folder contains the use cases for different AI tasks in the realm of earth observation (e.g., scene/object/pixel levels). It underpins the collaborative work of the Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence Standard Working Group of the Open Geospatial Consortium.
## 2. Introduction
The purpose of the TrainingDML-AI Use Cases is to demonstrate the task scenarios and training datasets that enable the modeling and use of TrainingDML:

- to define a range of earth observation task patterns and extensions that cover a set of core use cases specified;
- to identify and assess existing methods and standards;
- to drive consensus on training data modeling and encoding rules;
- to determine how training data can best be integrated with other data or service on the Web;
- to produce a set of best practices for the use of the TrainingDML-AI standard. 

This folder describes a set of evolving use cases which are the first steps of working towards these goals. Members of the Standard Working Group and stakeholders are working collaboratively to define a number of use cases that describe how different type of training datasets could work based on TrainingDML modeling and encoding. From these use cases, a number of requirements for further work are derived. In this folder, use cases, requirements and their relationships will be described. The requirements described in this folder will be the basis for development of the other deliverables of the Working Group.
